            <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
            <p>
            My earliest performances, in the late 70's, featured objects 
            which were masks or costume extensions of my own body. Dresses 
            and skirts of unusual materials-- 3,000 walnut shells, 90 lbs. 
            of glass, dozens of fresh fish--became an integral part of my 
            autobiographical performances. After a while, I felt alone onstage
             in these solo works, and I began to create small likenesses of 
             myself to take on certain supporting roles. These were my 
             first puppets. Soon, there were so many "little Theodoras" 
             onstage, that I was able to exit the performing arena and take 
             over the director's role outside the frame. My works expanded 
             out from autobiography, to consider large-scale subjects, such 
             as the history of American invention, genetics, food and famine, 
             incarcerated women and medicine. I have always felt that puppet 
             figures have an innocence and a purity that make them especially 
             effective in illuminating social and political issues.  Those 
             qualities, in addition to their ability to express deeply felt 
             emotions to an audience, have led me to incorporate a wide 
             variety of puppets into my performance and installation works 
             for the past four decades.

            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                Theodora Skipitares is a visual artist and theater director, 
                who has been creating her works for more than 40 years. Born 
                in San Francisco of Greek parents, she moved to New York in 1970. 
                Trained as a sculptor and theater designer, she worked briefly as 
                a designer for groups such as Richard Schechner's THE PERFORMANCE 
                GROUP, Omar Shapli's SECTION TEN, and Andrea Balis' THE CUTTING 
                EDGE. She began creating personal solo performances in the mid 
                1970's. Gradually, she moved away from autobiography, and began 
                to examine social and historical themes. Realistic, life-size 
                puppet figures, as well as miniature ones, became the performers 
                in large-scale works that included live music, film, video and 
                documentary texts. These works were often collaborations with 
                prominent composers such as Virgil Moorefield, Bobby Previte, 
                Scott Johnson, Pat Irwin, Barry Greenhut, David First, Tim 
                Schellenbaum, Arnold Dreyblatt, and most recently LaFrae Sci, 
                Mazz Swift, and Sxip Shirey. 
                These works include THE AGE OF INVENTION, an examination of 
                3 centuries of American ingenuity featuring 300 puppets, DEFENDERS 
                OF THE CODE, a history of eugenics, and THE RADIANT CITY, a 
                music-theater work based on the life of Robert Moses. More recent 
                projects include UNDER THE KNIFE, a site-specific story of 
                medicine which took an audience to twelve different theater 
                environments, and BODY OF CRIME, a history of women in prison. 
                In 1998 she premiered A HARLOT'S PROGRESS, a chamber opera 
                with life-size puppet figures based on the engraving series by 
                William Hogarth; in 2001 she completed OPTIC FEVER, an 
                exploration of Renaissance artists and their new way of seeing. 
                She has received a UNIMA Citation for Excellence in Puppetry, 
                a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship, 
                a McKnight Playwriting Fellowship, and a Helen Merrill Award 
                for Playwriting. DEFENDERS OF THE CODE was named one of the 10 
                Best Plays by the New York Times. A HARLOT'S PROGRESS is one of 
                the Burns Mantle 10 Best Plays of the 1997-8 season.  
                A HARLOT'S PROGRESS is also the winner of the American Theater 
                Wing's Hewes Design Award. 
                <br><br>
                Her visual work has been exhibited widely in the U.S., Europe 
                and South America. She traveled to Vietnam and Cambodia and 
                created opera works in collaboration with Ellen Stewart (founder 
                of La MaMa Theater) and national puppet theaters. She also 
                directed and designed a production of Charles Ludlam's THE 
                ENCHANTED PIG of Sundance Theater. Three times in the past 20 
                years, Ms. Skipitares has been a Fulbright Fellow in India, 
                where she has worked with Indian puppeteers and choreographers 
                to create new projects. 
                <br><br>
                When the Iraq War began in 2003, Ms. Skipitares returned 
                to the ancient Greek playwrights for inspiration and created 
                3 works about the long and bloody Trojan War:  HELEN, QUEEN 
                OF SPARTA; ODYSSEY: THE HOMECOMING; and IPHIGENIA. The cycle, 
                called TRILOGY, was completed in 2006. She continues to work 
                with Greek themes and authors, especially Euripides. In 2009, 
                she presented THE TRAVELING PLAYERS PRESENT THE WOMEN OF TROY,
                which connected the characters from the Euripides play to 4 
                contemporary female activists. 
                <br><br>
                In 2014, Skipitares left the plays of ancient Greece and 
                created an original work which is a "disruption" of Ionesco's 
                play THE CHAIRS. In this production, 24 animated chairs become 
                the heroes of the play. In 2016, with a nod to Pirandello, she 
                created SIX CHARACTERS (A Family Album). Her next three plays 
                addressed racial justice: THERE'S BLOOD AT THE WEDDING (2018) 
                is set within giant-scale book constructions, through which we 
                reflect on the lives and deaths of six victims of police violence 
                in the U.S., such as Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, and Eric 
                Garner. In 2020, she worked with high school students and their 
                Brooklyn marching band to create THE TRANSFIGURATION OF 
                BENJAMIN BANNEKER, an outdoor/indoor spectacle. In 2022, she 
                presented GRAND PANORAMA, which focused on Frederick Douglass' 
                obsession with photography. Douglass believed that this new 
                technology of the mid-19th century could help destroy slavery.
                <br><br>
                She has led workshops frequently in India, as well as in Vietnam, 
                Cambodia. Korea, Greece, Iran and the West Bank, Palestine.  
                Skipitares is Professor of Art and Design Education at Pratt 
                Institute in Brooklyn, New York. 
                <br><br>
                In 2023, 15 Orient <a style="color: pink;"href="https://15orient.com/index.php/theodora-skipitares-views-from-the-miniature-city/">exhibited</a> tableaux from Skipitares' 
                boundary-breaking 1981 MICROPOLIS in Bushwick. 
                <br><br>
                Reviewing the installation/performance, the New York Times 
                calls the show "a marvel which argues for the power of 
                puppetry" as a contemporary art medium.
